The Calgary Corpus
This was developed in the late 1980s, and during the 1990s became something of a de facto standard for lossless compression evaluation. The collection is now rather dated, but it is still reasonably reliable as a performance indicator. It is still available so that older results can be compared. The collection will not be changed, although there are four files (paper3, paper4, paper5 and paper6) that have been used in some evaluations but are no longer in the corpus because they don't add to the evaluation.

There are 14 files in this corpus:
